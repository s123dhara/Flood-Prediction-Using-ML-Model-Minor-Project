                    Our Flood Prediction Model is an advanced tool developed using state-of-the-art Machine Learning
                    techniques.
                    It collects and analyzes data from various sources such as weather forecasts, river water levels,
                    soil
                    moisture,
                    and historical flood data to provide accurate flood predictions. By leveraging this model, we aim to
                    help
                    governments, organizations, and communities make informed decisions to mitigate potential flood
                    risks.
