# Flood Prediction Using ML Model (Random Forest Algorithm)

This project uses a machine learning model based on the Random Forest algorithm to predict floods. The application is a web-based solution where users can interact with the model through a Node.js and Express.js backend. The model's predictions are made by a Python Flask server that processes the data and sends it back to the Node.js server for rendering and display.

## Project Overview

This application leverages machine learning to predict floods using a trained Random Forest model. Users interact with the web app by sending a request with input data, which is processed by the Python Flask server where the ML model makes predictions. The results are then rendered on the front-end using EJS templates.

### Workflow:
1. **User Interaction**: The user submits a request through the Node.js web application.
2. **Request Handling**: The request is forwarded to a Python Flask server.
3. **Prediction**: The Flask server processes the request, passes it through the trained Random Forest model, and returns the predicted results.
4. **Display**: The Node.js server receives the prediction and renders it on the web page using EJS templates.

## Features

- **Flood Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of floods based on the provided data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple web interface that displays the prediction results to the user.
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast prediction using the Random Forest model.
  
## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Flask, Random Forest Algorithm (using `scikit-learn`)
- **Deployment**: Local or cloud servers for Node.js and Python Flask
- **Communication**: HTTP requests between Node.js and Flask servers
